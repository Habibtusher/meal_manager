# Landing Page Responsiveness Implementation Plan

The goal is to ensure the landing page looks stunning and functions perfectly across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## 1. Navbar (Header) Improvements
- [ ] Implement a mobile menu (hamburger menu) using a state toggle.
- [ ] Add smooth transitions for the mobile menu appearance.
- [ ] Ensure the logo and "Get Started" button are always appropriately scaled.

## 2. Hero Section Refinement
- [ ] Adjust font sizes for the headline on mobile to prevent awkward line breaks.
- [ ] Optimize the "float" animation and decorative elements for smaller screens (prevent overflow).
- [ ] Center text and actions on mobile while maintaining the side-by-side layout on desktop.

## 3. Features Section Optimization
- [ ] Ensure the grid layout transitions smoothly from 1 column (mobile) to 2 columns (tablet) and 3 columns (desktop).
- [ ] Adjust card padding and icon sizes for smaller touch targets.

## 4. CTA Section Polish
- [ ] Scale down the large heading on mobile devices.
- [ ] Adjust the border radius and padding of the CTA box for smaller viewports.
- [ ] Stack buttons vertically on very small screens if necessary.

## 5. Footer Enhancements
- [ ] Improve the 2-column grid to look better on mobile (maybe stack some sections).
- [ ] Ensure the copyright and social links are centered or properly aligned on mobile.

## 6. General UX
- [ ] Audit all horizontal margins and paddings to ensure no content is clipped on narrow devices.
- [ ] Verify font readability across different screen resolutions.
